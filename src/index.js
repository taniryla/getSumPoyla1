// // First, we have to understand the problem.
// Write a function that takes 2 numbers and returns their sum

// // 1. What is the unknown?
// the sum of 2 numbers

// // 2. What are the data inputs?
// a, b
// // 3. Can you restate the problem in your own words?
// add a and b together
// // 4. Can the unknown be determined from the data inputs?
// yes except large numbers
// // 5. Is the data inputs sufficient to determine the unknown? Insufficient? Redundant? Contradictory?
// yes
// 6. How should I label important pieces of data input that are a part of the problem?
// // 7. Draw a figure. Introduce suitable notation.
// this is a basic problem
// 8. Separate the various parts of the condition. Can you write them down?

function getSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
